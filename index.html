                <p class = "bg-dark color-AHC-yellow extraPadding">This picture is of the Logo of Aqua Hydrocity. Logo was designed by Vi Snyder, the founders of Aqua Hydrocity, he wanted a design that was simple but looked nice. 
                  So he decided to settle with the logo, he chose the three colors of yellow, red, and blue for what elements the correspond with. The yellow repersents lighting, something
                  that he likes to look at as it strikes. Red is for fire, and blue is for water.

                <p class = "bg-dark color-AHC-yellow">This picture is of a conduit in Minecraft. Since Aqua Hydrocity was going to be constructed in Minecraft, there was a small problem. You can't breathe underwater normally, so Vi 
                  found out about the heart of the sea. The heart of the sea plus shells make a conduit. The conduit allows players to breathe underwater. 
                  He was going to put it in the middle of Aqua Hydrocity to allow the players to breathe all over the city.

                  This picture is of Vi's house in the minecraft realm. This house was going to be either the entrence point to Aqua Hydrocity, a little pit stop to the city, or just a storage shed to store items not needed at the moment. 
                  His house had a nether portal in it leading to the portal network, so it would have been a good place to put the entrence to the city. The house is suppost to be a brige between water and land.

          <p class = "text-dark" id = "moveUpABit">Aqua Hydrocity got its name from Vi thinking about what name would stand out among all the other towns. Because Aqua Hydrocity
            means water water city it seemed like a good fit. Being that the city was fully underwater.
          </p>
          
          <p class = "text-dark" id = "moveUpABit">Aqua Hydrocity, AHC, was created by Vi Snyder on a Minecraft realm. It had was partnered with the Flower Kingdom, which was the neighbor of AHC,
            they had a bridge connection between each of the locations. However, the AHC construction underwater never began.
            Now Aqua Hydrocity is just the "company" they created and use.

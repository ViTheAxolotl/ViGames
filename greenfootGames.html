            <li>Pong - (2 Player Game) Go against your opponent and hit the ball into their score. This the normal game Pong but with a twist. Fruit will summon every once in awhile. The fruit will either 
              boost you or deboost your opponent. Credits: Images made by Levi Snyder, Sounds made by Levi Snyder, Concept made by Levi Snyder, Code made by Levi Snyder.</li>

              <li>Out of Breath - (1 Player Game) You play a girl named Mack. She fell out of her submarine while going to do research on why the sea creatures are becoming super hostile. She landed miles 
                away form the drop site. Having to hurry on and put on her suit she didn't have time to make sure she had enought oxygen. Now you must find away to be reunited with the sub before your oxygen runs out and you die.
